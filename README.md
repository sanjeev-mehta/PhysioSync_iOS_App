## Good Coding Practice:

### Commit Message Guidelines

- **First Line Summary:**

  - Example: "feat: patient-sign-up-api"

**Conventional/Semantic Commit Message Guide:**

- **build:** Change to the build system.
- **chore:** A programming chore with little/no impact on code.
  - Example: Bumping version numbers, updating dependencies.

- **ci:** Change to the continuous integration system.
- **docs:** Change to user/API documentation (not comments).
- **feat:** Add a new feature. Results in a new MINOR version number.

**Commit Description Guidelines:**

  - Bad: "Fixed issue with login button" or "Fixing issue with login button"
